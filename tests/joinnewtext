Be our guest
Our meetings are open for everybody, so you don’t need to sing up to visit — simply come to our next meeting! We conduct presentations, host exercises, and so on, which means you won't get bored.
Become a member
Official members can take part in our debate sessions, become timers / fact-checkers, and vote on important topics. Also, you will be added to our group chat! <br> To join, talk to us during the meeting, or write us an email.
We encourage everyone to treat our meetings as a formal occasion. That means dressing nicely, respecting each other, and minding your manners. That's not a "rule" you're forced to follow, that's simply our culture!
Be your own organiser
The Debate club is made by students, for students. To make our meetings engaging and practical, our members prepare their own presentations, exercises, debate topics, etc. If you’d like to organize something of your own, please fill out the following form: *link*
